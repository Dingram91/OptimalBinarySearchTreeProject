# OptimalBinarySearchTreeProject
Project for testing runtimes of the optimal binary search tree function (Dynamic Programming) (COT 3400 - CRN 14000)

## Running
The project is run from the command line.

### Example Input
"java -jar OptimalBinarySearchTreeProject-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar"

### Design Decisions
To generate the data a Gaussian distribution was used with a spread equal to half of the number of keys being generated. The keys were saved to the data folder for logging purposes.
